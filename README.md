# LeetCode Solutions ðŸš€

This repository contains my curated solutions to LeetCode problems as I prepare for FAANG interviews, with a focus on roles in **Data Science**, **ML Engineering**, and **AI Product Development**.

## ðŸ’¡ Goals
- Sharpen algorithmic thinking and problem-solving speed
- Master core data structures and algorithms for interviews
- Build a consistent habit through daily LeetCode practice
- Improve understanding of patterns and time-space complexity
- Complement ML system design and AI engineering prep

## ðŸ§± Structure
Solutions are organized by difficulty and language (Python)
